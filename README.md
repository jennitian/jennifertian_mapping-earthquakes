# Mapping Earthquakes
module 13 challenge

## Goals
To create a local host that maps and identifies earthquakes across the world within the past 7 days live. This map is accompanied with information on each earthquake including location and magnitude as well as a map showing the location of tectonic plates to inform people on earthquake patterns around the world.

### Resources
To create this project, I used mapbox to map locations, leaflet for design elements, and various json files from earthquakes.usgs.gov and github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates to map earthquakes and tectonic plate locations.
